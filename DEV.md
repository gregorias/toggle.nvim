## ADR

### Keymap hints

The icons in keymap hints represent the intended state after pressing the
keymap, e.g., a turned on toggle for `]o`. This is done so to make the icon
congruent with the text in Which Key. The text says ‚ÄúTurn on foo,‚Äù so the icon
should be congruent to avoid
[the Stroop effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect).
