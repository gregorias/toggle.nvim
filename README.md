</div>

Toggle is a modern, extensible Neovim Lua plugin for toggling options ala
[unimpaired.vim][unimpaired].

Do you have togglable options that you ocassionally want to change during your
Neovim session? For example:

- You usually have `nowrap` on, but sometimes you need to turn on wrapping for
  those long lines to see what‚Äôs going on.
- You want to quickly diff two buffers by setting `diffthis` on them.
- Completion turns out to be useless for the current buffer, so you want to
  quickly disable it.
- You usually work with `conceallevel`, but you need to decrease it from time
  to time to double check your Markdown.

Then Toggle is a plugin for you!

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

| Option       | Keymap | Description                            |
| :--          | :--:   | :--                                    |
| conceallevel | `cl`   | 0‚Äì3 slider with 0-sticky toggle        |
| diff         | `d`    | on-off switch for `diffthis`/`diffoff` |
| diff all     | `D`    | option for diffing all visible windows |
| wrap         | `w`    | on-off switch for `wrap`               |

## üôè Acknowledgments

The idea of quickly toggling options using `yo`, `[o` `]o` came from
[unimpaired.vim][unimpaired].

The toggle SVG is a modified icon from [Arthur Shlain](https://usefulicons.com/).
